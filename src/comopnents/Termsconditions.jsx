            <p>
              Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you 
              place an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail 
              confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order 
              (the "Order Confirmation Email"). The Order Confirmation Email is a 
              confirmation that we have received your order and is not a confirmation of 
              acceptance of your offer to purchase the product(s) ordered. We will only 
              accept your offer and enter into the contract of sale for a product ordered 
              by you when the product is dispatched to you and you receive an e-mail 
              confirmation that the product has been dispatched to you (the "Dispatch 
              Confirmation Email"). If your order is shipped in multiple packages, you may 
              receive a separate shipping confirmation for each package, and each shipping 
              confirmation and corresponding shipment will form a separate contract of sale 
              between you and us for the product(s) specified in that shipping confirmation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Your contract is with us (the sellers) and you confirm that you have purchased 
              the product(s) you have ordered for your internal/personal use and not for 
              resale or business purposes. You authorize us to declare on your behalf and 
              declare to any government authority the above intended use of the product(s) 
              ordered by you from the Website.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You may cancel your order for a product free of charge at any time before we 
              send the shipping confirmation for that product by e-mail.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Please note that we only sell products in quantities that correspond to the 
              typical requirements of an average household. This applies both to the number 
              of products ordered within a single order and to the placing of multiple orders 
              for the same product if the individual orders comprise a quantity typical of a 
              normal household.
